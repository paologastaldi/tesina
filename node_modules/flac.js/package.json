  "readme": "flac.js: A FLAC decoder in JavaScript\n=====================================\n\nThe Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is a widely used lossless audio codec, which means that the audio is compressed \nwithout any loss of quality.  A decoded FLAC stream is bit-for-bit identical to the original uncompressed audio file.\n\nThe JavaScript decoder was ported from the [FFMpeg project](http://ffmpeg.org/) and the demuxer is based on the original\n[FLAC documentation](http://flac.sourceforge.net/format.html).  flac.js uses the \n[Aurora](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js) audio framework by ofmlabs to facilitate decoding and playback.\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can check out a [demo](http://audiocogs.org/codecs/flac/) alongside our other decoders \n[alac.js](http://github.com/audiocogs/alac.js), [MP3.js](http://github.com/devongovett/mp3.js), and [AAC.js](http://github.com/audiocogs/aac.js).  Currently flac.js\nworks properly in the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.\n\n## Authors\n\nflac.js was written by [@jensnockert](http://github.com/jensnockert) and [@devongovett](http://github.com/devongovett) \nof [Audiocogs](http://audiocogs.org/).\n\n## Building\n    \nWe use [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to build flac.js.  You can download a\nprebuilt version from the Github [releases](https://github.com/audiocogs/flac.js/releases) page. \nTo build flac.js for the browser yourself, use the following commands:\n\n    npm install\n    make browser\n    \nThis will place a built `flac.js` file, as well as a source map in the `build/` directory.\n\nflac.js depends on [Aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js), our audio codec framework.\nFor detailed information on how to use Aurora.js, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js/wiki).\n    \n## License\n\nflac.js is licensed under the same terms as the original FLAC decoder in FFMpeg.
