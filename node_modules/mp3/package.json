  "readme": "MP3.js - a JavaScript MP3 for Aurora.js\n================================================\n\nMP3.js is a refactored version of [JSMad](https://github.com/ofmlabs/jsmad) designed to run in the \n[Aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js) audio framework.  It supports all of the\nfeatures of JSMad and is released under the same GPLv2 license.  The code was reorganized a bit, and now\nuses all typed arrays for decoding at better performance.\n\nMP3.js adds support for layer I and II to the existing support for layer III. It also supports free bitrate streams, \nand improves performance thanks to the use of typed arrays.\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can check out a [demo](http://audiocogs.org/codecs/mp3/) alongside our other decoders \n[alac.js](http://github.com/audiocogs/alac.js), [flac.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/flac.js), and [AAC.js](http://github.com/audiocogs/aac.js).  Currently MP3.js\nworks properly in the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.\n\n## Authors\n\nJSMad was originally written by [@nddrylliog](https://twitter.com/nddrylliog), \n[@jensnockert](https://twitter.com/jensnockert), and [@mgeorgi](https://twitter.com/mgeorgi) during a Music Hack Day. The \nrefactor for MP3.js was performed by [@devongovett](https://twitter.com/devongovett).\n\n## Building\n    \nWe use [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to build MP3.js.  You can download a\nprebuilt version from the Github [releases](https://github.com/audiocogs/mp3.js/releases) page. \nTo build MP3.js for the browser yourself, use the following commands:\n\n    npm install\n    make browser\n    \nThis will place a built `mp3.js` file, as well as a source map in the `build/` directory.\n\nMP3.js depends on [Aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js), our audio codec framework.\nFor detailed information on how to use Aurora.js, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js/wiki).\n## License\n\nMP3.js follows the same jsmad license. MP3.js is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, \nVersion 2. Please note that under the GPL, there is absolutely no warranty of any kind, to the extent permitted by the law.\n\n## Future\n\n- MPEG 2.5 is not supported.\n- Most of ID3v2.2 and ID3v2.3 are implemented, but some tags are missing.\n",
