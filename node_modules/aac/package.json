  "readme": "AAC.js: A JavaScript AAC Decoder\n================================\n\nAdvanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a standardized, high quality lossy audio codec, designed as the successor to the MP3 format.  AAC is now\none of the most widely deployed audio codecs, and such names as the iTunes Store distribute music in the AAC format.\n\nAAC can be played in a limited number of browsers using the HTML5 audio element, however, some browsers do not support the codec \nfor various reasons.  AAC.js enables playback and other decoding tasks in all browsers using the \n[Aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js) audio framework.\n\nAAC.js is based on the prior work of many open source projects, including [JAAD](http://jaadec.sourceforge.net), \n[FAAD](http://www.audiocoding.com/faad2.html), [FFMpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/), and [Helix Datatype](https://datatype.helixcommunity.org).\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can check out a [demo](http://audiocogs.org/codecs/aac/) alongside our other decoders [MP3.js](http://github.com/devongovett/mp3.js), [flac.js](http://github.com/audiocogs/flac.js), and [alac.js](http://github.com/audiocogs/alac.js).  Currently, AAC.js works properly in the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.\n\n## Authors\n\nAAC.js was written by [@devongovett](http://github.com/devongovett) of [Audiocogs](http://audiocogs.org/).\n\n## Building\n\nWe use [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to build AAC.js.  You can download a\nprebuilt version from the Github [releases](https://github.com/audiocogs/aac.js/releases) page. \nTo build AAC.js for the browser yourself, use the following commands:\n\n    npm install\n    make browser\n    \nThis will place a built `aac.js` file, as well as a source map in the `build/` directory.\n\nAAC.js depends on [Aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js), our audio codec framework.\nFor detailed information on how to use Aurora.js, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js/wiki).\n\n## Features\n\nAAC.js supports the AAC Low Complexity Profile, which is the most common profile.  Support for the Main, High Efficiency \n(Spectral Band Replication) and High Efficiency v2 (Spectral Band Replication + Parametric Stereo) profiles is planned.\nOther profiles, such as the low delay, and error resilient profiles are not supported, but we'd love pull requests if \nyou feel motivated to implement them! :)\n\n## License\n\nAAC.js is licensed under the LGPL.\n\n    AAC.js is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it \n    under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as \n    published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the \n    License, or (at your option) any later version.\n    \n    AAC.js is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT \n    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY \n    or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
